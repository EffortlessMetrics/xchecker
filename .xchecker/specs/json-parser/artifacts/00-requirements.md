The requirements packet file is empty. I need more information from you to create the requirements document. Could you provide:

1. **Problem Statement**: What problem is the JSON parser solving?
2. **Scope**: What are the key features or capabilities the JSON parser should have?
3. **Users/Roles**: Who will be using this JSON parser? (e.g., developers, data analysts, end-users)
4. **Key Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints? (e.g., performance requirements, data size limits, specific JSON features to support)
5. **Context**: Is this a parser for the xchecker project itself, or a standalone tool?

Once you provide this information, I'll create a comprehensive structured requirements document following the EARS format with user stories and specific acceptance criteria.
